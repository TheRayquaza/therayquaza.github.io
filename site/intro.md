# Welcome

## Who is writting this ?

I am a student at EPITA in Paris eager to learn more about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and other related field of AI.
As a simple student (+ french), the content of this book might be false, partially false or not clear and I am really sorry about this.
Feel free to contact me if you have any advice to improve my content, I will be really happy to talk with experts.

## Why this website ?

As I am trying to start my career in data science, I decided to write about the techniques I am learning because I believe writting will help me strengthen my understanding in AI. I also report some experiments and contents I find interesting.

I am also including personal touch in some parts of this book such as experiment oriented on performance for production and in the future, various techniques used in MLOps, Big Data and new technonology used for today's applications.
